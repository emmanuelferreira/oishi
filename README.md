As consumers we all have different buying criteria, and we do struggle when in comes to make the right choices with our purchases. Ideally we would choose the products that are the best for our body and our planet :earth_africa:. However, lack of time, poor information or a reduced budget prevents us from focusing on quality. That’s why Oishi offers a wide selection of choices among products, allowing you to select the **most suitable products** according to **your constraints**. We provide an adapted dashboard in order to track your consumption, so that you can develop a full awareness of the impact of your purchases. Rest assured, the objective is not to make you feel guilty, but only to ensure an honest and neutral history of your purchasing behavior.
